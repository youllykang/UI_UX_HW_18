    <div id= bio>
        <p>I'm a UI / UX designer. I have a  B.A. in Psychology, but also I've  consistently nurtured my interest in the creative arts and was particularly notorious for my "perfect" handwriting. After I graduated from college, I pursued my interest in understanding people through a career in the social sciences field while doing graphic design, illustration, and calligraphy on the side. As I gained work experience and grew more awareness about myself in the work settling, I realized that I love using my empathy to understand people and their needs, but I wanted my work to be more design-focused. The stars all aligned when I became a UI / UX designer.
